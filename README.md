# cash-rip
Implementation of cash rip for Bitcoin cash using multi signature addresses and the electrumcash wallet.

Concenptually, this mimics a real-world interaction where the buyer rips a cash note in half and gives the merchant one half.
The two halves are useless for both parties. After the buyer receives his item and he is happy, he can give his half to the 
merchant who then sticky-tapes the two halves together and can spend the money.
